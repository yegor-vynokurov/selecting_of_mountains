Mt Meru is a challenging multiday trek that takes you up this dormant volcano to reach Socialist Peak (4,562 m), the highest point on the crater rim. On Meru, you hike through the same vegetation zones as neighbouring Mt Kilimanjaro, just not the ice-and-snow summit. Excitingly, you see much more wildlife on a Meru climb, like buffaloes, giraffes, flamingoes and zebras. And the views of Kilimanjaro throughout the climb are just sublime!
