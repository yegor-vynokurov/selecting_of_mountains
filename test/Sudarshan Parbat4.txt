Sudarshan Parbat, Uttarakhand
Said to be the first mountain peak visible on the right side of the Gangotri Valley, Sudarshan Parbat is yet another impressive six thousand peak in the Gangotri Group of Peaks. The base camp for the Sudarshan Parbat climbing expedition begins from Raktavarn Glacier, which is adjacent to Gangotri Glacier the originating point of River Ganga. Sudarshan Parbat summit bid gets technically difficult as one has to survive extensive crevassed grounds and places with loose rocks and soft snow. There are also razor-sharp sections that make climbing a tad more challenging. However, all the weariness vanishes when crests the peak from where Gangotri Peaks and the valley, a little of Tibet and all the neighboring peaks can be seen.
