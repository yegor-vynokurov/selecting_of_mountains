Sudarshan Parbat (6507m) is a mountain hard to miss on the trek from Gangotri towards Gaumukh. Sudarshan Parbat is the first ‘big’ mountain on the right side of the valley and is approached through the Raktavarn glacier, which in turn is part of the much larger Gangotri glacier. We would be climbing the peak through the West Ridge. A cluster of major peaks such as Mt. Saifee, Mt. Thelu, Mt. Koteshwar, Mt. Swetwarn, Chaturbhuj etc. surround Sudarshan Parbat. Setting the base camp at the Raktavarn glacier, we would be putting up three more camps before the final assault on the summit. The major glaciers that describe the Gangotri region are the Gangotri, Chaturangi and Raktavarn, which lie adjacent to each other. At Gaumukh (Cow`s Mouth), the source of the holy Ganges can be observed that is emerging from the depths of the glacier, and the shape of the ice formation is indeed like a cow`s mouth. Immediately opposite of the Gaumukh is Shivling (6543 metres), a towering pinnacle of rare beauty and of equally severe technical difficulty.
