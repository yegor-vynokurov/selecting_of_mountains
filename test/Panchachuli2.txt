Panchachuli-2 (6,904 m)
This is the highest peak in the group and the highest peak lying entirely in the Kumaon region. It was first climbed successfully by an Indo-Tibetan Border Police team, led by Mahendra Singh, on 26 May 1973. The team climbed from the Balati plateau and via the southwest ridge to the summit. The coordinates of the peak are Latitude 30°12'51" and Longitude 80°25'39".[1]

Panchachuli-3 (6,312 m)
Though this peak has been not climbed, there have been a few expeditions and attempts to do so. The first attempt was in 1996 via the Dakshini Balati Glacier on the Munsiyari side. This attempt ended after an accident and an avalanche occurred.[2] The second attempt was done in 1998, by a large Indian Army expedition, led by Colonel Bhatt of the Engineer Corps of the Indian Army, via the Duktu Glacier on the Dhauli Ganga river side. This too was not successful as the team summiting had an accident on the final approach ridge.[3]

Other reports of a successful climb have not been independently verified.

The coordinates of this peak are Latitude 30°12'00" and Longitude 80°26'24".
