Geography
Kalanka lies on the outer rim of the Nanda Devi sanctuary and in between Changabang and Saf Minal.

The mountain is surrounded by glaciers on three sides: Changabang on the southern side, Uttari Rishi on the eastern side, and Bagini on the northern side. The river from the Bagini Glacier meets with the Dhauliganga River at Jumma. Changabang Bamak (Glacier) and Uttari Rishi Bamak (Glacier) also intersect with the Dhauliganga River through the Rishi Ganga gorge. The Dhauliganga River joins with the Alaknanda river at Vishnu Prayag, the two main tributaries of Dhauliganga. These two main rivers meet at Devpryag. The name Ganga starts from there.

The entire surrounding area is protected within the 2,236.74 km2 (863.61 sq mi) Nanda Devi National Park or Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site declared by UNESCO.[7] The Nanda Devi National Park is home to several world-class treks.
