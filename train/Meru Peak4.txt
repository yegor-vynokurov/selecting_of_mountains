The peak can be ascended in 3 or 4 days on the Momela Route, which is the only way up to the summit. You don't need any technical equipment for the climb but you will need to be prepared for the altitude gain. You will hike past wildlife, the landscape is spectacular, and sunrise on the summit has Kilimanjaro as the backdrop. Meru is a great preparation hike for climbing Kilimanjaro, or a spectacular trek for those not compelled to do Kilimanjaro. The climb not only offers spectacular views of Mount Kilimanjaro, but also wildlife on the forested slopes and the summit itself offers an amazing view of small cones and craters, which are probably the results of numerous volcanic activities in the past.
Kilimanjaro may be the main attraction in Tanzania, but Mt. Meru is worth your attention as well.

Although it is 4,000 feet shorter than Kilimanjaro, solitary Mt. Meru nonetheless cuts an impressive figure and makes for a challenging acclimatisation hike or an attraction in its own right.

While all of our climbing itineraries are private, it is policy on Mt. Meru for multiple tour groups to join together on the lower slopes.
