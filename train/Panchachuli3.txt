This May, I, my wife and two friends embarked on the Panchachuli trek. The objective was to go to the base camp and stay there in tents for a few days. We were told that a motorable road exists which takes one right from Dharchula to Duktu village from where the base camp is just 4-5 km away. The reality was a bit different! Yes, a road exists but in early May, the road was unsuitable for any vehicular traffic. Huge tongues of snow and ice had descended together with falling rocks and trees. So, driving to Duktu was out. We decided to walk along the Darma Valley. Three local porters/guides accompanied us. We walked through the villages of Nagling, Baling and then Dantu. There was large quantities of snow on the mountains, on the hillsides and some on the road. We stayed in homestay in Nagling and Dantu, while in Baling we stayed in fibre glass "igloo huts". We had simple food with the villagers - dal, roti, rice and sometimes bari (soybean nuggets). There was no onions or tomatoes because supply trucks have not yet made their way. We thoroughly enjoyed our journey. When we reached Dantu, the weather was bad and we shivered at night fully clothed and under blankets with a snowstorm raging outside. And in the next morning we were greeted by an ethereal sight - a full view of Panchachulis covered with a thick blanket of snow. Trekking to the base camp was not possible. But we were sated. What a trip! The views all along were extraordinary. The villagers were friendly and welcoming wherever we went. We wish we stayed there for longer. We wished we never had to return.
